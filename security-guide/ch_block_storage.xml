    <title>Block Storage</title>
    <para>OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) is a service that provides
        software (services and libraries) to self-service manage
        persistent block-level storage devices.  This creates
        on-demand access to Block Storage resources for use with
        OpenStack Compute (nova) instances.  This creates
        software-defined storage via abstraction by virtualizing
        pools of block storage to a variety of back-end storage
        devices which can be either software implementations or
        traditional hardware storage products.  The primary functions
        of this is to manage the creation, attaching and detaching of
        the block devices. The consumer requires no knowledge of the
        type of back-end storage equipment or where it is located.
    </para>
    <para>Compute instances store and retrieve block storage via
        industry-standard storage protocols such as iSCSI, ATA over
        Ethernet, or Fibre-Channel.  These resources are managed and
        configured via OpenStack native standard HTTP RESTful API.
        For more details on the API see the

        <para>Whilst this chapter is currently sparse on specific
            guidance, it is expected that standard hardening practices
            will be followed.  This section will be expanded with relevant
            information.</para>
