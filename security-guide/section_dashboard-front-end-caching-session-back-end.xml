        <title>Front-end caching</title>
        <para>We do not recommend using front-end caching tools with the
          dashboard. The dashboard is rendering dynamic content resulting
          directly from OpenStack API requests and front-end caching layers
          such as varnish can prevent the correct content from being
          displayed. In Django, static media is directly served from Apache
          or nginx and already benefits from web host caching.</para>

    <section xml:id="dashboard-session-back-end">
        <title>Session back end</title>
        <para>The default session back end for horizon
          (<literal>django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies</literal>)
          saves user data in signed, but unencrypted cookies stored in the
          browser. Due to the fact that each dashboard instance is
          stateless, the previously mentioned methodology provides the
          ability to implement the most simple session back-end scaling.</para>
        <para>It should be noted that with this type of implementation
          sensitive access tokens will be stored in the browser and will be
          transmitted with each request made. The back end ensures the
          integrity of session data, even though the transmitted data
          is only encrypted by HTTPS.</para>
        <para>If your architecture allows it, we recommend using
          <literal>django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache</literal> as
          your session back end with memcache as the cache. Memcache must
          not be exposed publicly, and should communicate over a secured
          private channel. If you choose to use the signed cookies
          back end, refer to the Django documentation to understand the
          security trade-offs.</para>
