HTTP POST limiting advised to avoid Essex/Folsom Keystone DoS
---

### Summary ###
Concurrent Keystone POST requests with large body messages are held in memory
without filtering or rate limiting, this can lead to resource exhaustion on the
Keystone server.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Keystone, Databases

### Discussion ###
Keystone stores POST messages in memory before validation, concurrent
submission of multiple large POST messages can cause the Keystone process to be
killed due to memory exhaustion, resulting in a remote Denial of Service.

In many cases Keystone will be deployed behind a load-balancer or proxy that
can rate limit POST messages inbound to Keystone. Grizzly is protected
against that through the sizelimit middleware.

### Recommended Actions ###
If you are in a situation where Keystone is directly exposed to incoming POST
messages and not protected by the sizelimit middleware there are a number of
load-balancing/proxy options, we suggest you consider one of the following:

Nginx: Open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy.
Nginx Config: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#client_max_body_size

Apache: HTTP Server Project
Apache Config: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody
