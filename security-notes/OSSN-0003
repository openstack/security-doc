Keystone configuration should not be world readable
---

### Summary ###
In some deployments keystone.conf which contains confidential information, is
set to world readable.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Keystone, DevStack, Deployment

### Discussion ###
It is important that deployers of OpenStack ensure that keystone.conf is not
world readable. In some deployments the keystone configuration file is readable
by all users (and processes) on the installation system. This file should be
set with the most restrictive permissions that allow the system to continue
proper operations.

In particular, the password configuration of the LDAP section and the
admin_token contain secret information:

---- being example config snippet ----
[ldap]
url = ldap://localhost
user = dc=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
password = None <- should be secret
suffix = cn=example,cn=com
use_dumb_member = False
allow_subtree_delete = False
dumb_member = cn=dumb,dc=example,dc=com

[DEFAULT]
admin_token = passw0rd <- should be secret
---- end example config snippet ----

### Recommended Actions ###
Ensure that in your deployment keystone.conf uses the most restrictive
permissions that allow the system to continue proper operations.
