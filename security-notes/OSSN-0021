Owners of compromised accounts should verify Keystone trusts
---

### Summary ###
The Keystone 'trusts' API allows for delegation of privileges to one
user on behalf of another. This API can allow for an attacker of a
compromised account to set up backdoor access into the account. This
backdoor may not be easily detected, even if the account compromise is
detected.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Keystone, Grizzly, Havana, Icehouse

### Discussion ###
The Keystone trusts system allows for delegation of roles to Keystone
users without disclosing the main token, or sharing the account secret
key with those users. That means, after an account is compromised, the
change of the secret key and the invalidation of existing tokens may not
be enough to prevent future access from an attackers.

If an attacker obtains access to the account (via stolen credentials or
service exploitation), they can create a new Keystone trust. This new
trust may grant access not dependent on any knowledge of the compromised
user's secret key and can also be set to never expire. In this case, the
trust has to be manually found and removed by the account owner.

Information about using trusts can be found at:

### Recommended Actions ###
If the account has been compromised, or is being audited, the owner
should check the list of active trusts and verify that:

- all the active trusts are needed
- all the active trusts have the expected roles and delegation depth
- all the active trusts have appropriate expiration lifetimes

At the time of writing this OSSN, trusts can be listed by using the
Keystone API directly:

---- begin CLI example ----
    # get ENDPOINT from the last field of the output
    keystone endpoint-get --service identity --attr versionId \
      --value 3.0
    # get TOKEN from the last field of the output
    keystone token-get
    # list the trusts by running:
    curl -i -X GET "ENDPOINT/trusts/" -H "X-Auth-Token: TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json"
---- end CLI example ----

If some trust (with id TRUST_ID) is identified as invalid, it can be
deleted using:

---- begin CLI example ----
    curl -i -X DELETE "ENDPOINT/trusts/TRUST_ID" \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Accept: application/json"
---- end CLI example ----

In the future, operators will be able to use keystoneclient for a more
convenient method of accessing and updating this information.
