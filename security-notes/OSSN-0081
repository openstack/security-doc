sha512_crypt is insufficient for password hashing
-------------------------------------------------

### Summary ###

Use of sha512_crypt for password hashing in versions of Keystone prior to Pike,
is insufficient and provides limited protection against brute-forcing of
password hashes.

### Affected Services / Software ###
OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone). OpenStack Releases Ocata, Newton.

### Discussion ###

Keystone uses sha512_crypt for password hashing. This provides insufficient and
limited protection, since sha512_crypt algorithm has a low computational cost
factor, therefore making it easier to crack passwords offline in a short period
of time.

The correct mechanism is to use the more secure hashing algorithms with a
higher computational cost factor such as bcrypt, scrypt, or pbkdf2_sha512
instead of sha512_crypt.

### Recommended Actions ###

It is recommended that operators upgrade to the Pike release where all future
passwords would be bcrypt hashed.

Operators should also force password changes on all users [1], which will
result in the users newly generated passwords being bcrypt hashed.
