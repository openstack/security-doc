OpenStack Security Notes (OSSN)
===============================

The OpenStack Security Group (OSSG) publishes Security Notes to advise users
of security related issues. Security notes are similar to advisories; they
address vulnerabilities in 3rd party tools typically used within OpenStack
deployments and provide guidance on common configuration mistakes that can
result in an insecure operating environment.
